There is an increasing need for transparency and fairness in Machine Learning (ML) models predictions. Consider for example a banker who has to explain to a client why his/her loan application is rejected, or a health professional who must explain what constitutes his/her diagnosis. Some ML models are indeed very accurate, but are considered to be hard to explain, relatively to popular linear models. Source of figure : James, Gareth, et al. An introduction to statistical learning. Vol. 112. New York: springer, 2013. We do not want to sacrifice this high accuracy to explainability. Hence: ML explainability . There are a lot of ML explainability tools out there, in the wild (don't take my word for it). The teller is a model-agnostic tool for ML explainability - agnostic, as long as this model possesses methods fit and predict . The teller 's philosophy is to rely on Taylor series to explain ML models predictions: a little increase in model's explanatory variables + a little decrease, and we can obtain approximate sensitivities of its predictions to changes in these explanatory variables.

Purpose A primary goal of this project is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, and most importantly with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible . As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion, or lack of religion thereof. This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate to the project, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We invite all those who participate in, to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone. 2. Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to encourage participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on other participants. Communities mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. 3. Expected Behavior The following behaviors are expected and requested of all contributors: Attempt collaboration before conflict . Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this project. Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions. Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. 4. Unacceptable Behavior The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable: Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person. Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language. Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material. Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information (\"doxing\"). Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability. Inappropriate photography or recording. Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes. Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person). Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior. 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior Unacceptable behavior from any contributor will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a contributor engages in unacceptable behavior, appropriate action will be taken, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion without warning. 6. Scope We expect all contributors to abide by this Code of Conduct in all venues, online and in-person. 7. Contact info thierry.moudiki AT gmail.com 8.
